I enjoy building things that live on the internet or a desktop PC. For the past fourteen years (since 2006), I have worked on a wide variety of interesting and meaningful projects on a daily basis.

* .NET Framework and .NET Core
* JavaScript (ES6+)
* Node.js
* React, Angular and Vue
* Redux
* HTML and CSS (SCSS/LESS)
* Next.js

Also, as a DevOps engineer I have worked with the following technologies:

* Microsoft Azure
